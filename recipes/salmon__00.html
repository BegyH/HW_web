I've already shared this popular recipe with many of my friends. The best thing is it's so easy to make!</p>			<ul>				<li>1/4 c. dry sherry</li>				<li>2 T. soy sauce</li>				<li>2 T. vegetable oil</li>				<li>2 t. dry mustard</li>				<li>3-4 T. freshly minced garlic</li>				<li>1 to 2 lbs salmon filets</li>			</ul>			<ol>				<li>Mix together first 5 ingredients in a shallow dish.</li> 				<li>Place the cleaned and de-boned salmon filets face down in the mixture and allow to marinate for 1/2 to 1 hour. (Tip, I cut a large piece of salmon into the serving sizes before marinating so the marinade can coat the sides of each piece as well.)</li> 				<li>Preheat the broiler.</li> 				<li>Transfer filets to a baking sheet, skin-down. </li> 				<li>Broil the salmon on the top rack for 7 to 9 minutes, or until done to your liking (I like it still pink in the center).</li> 				<li>I usually serve this with an aromatic rice and a lightly seasoned stir fry.</li> 			</ol>			<li><a class="button" href="../start.html">Back to the home page</a></li>		</div>	</body><html>
