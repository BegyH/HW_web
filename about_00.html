			<h1>About Jen's Kitchen</h1>
			<p>
				The recipes listed here are ones that I have developed myself. In some
				cases, I started with a recipe found in a cookbook or magazine, but over
				time, I've adapted it enough to call it my own. Bon Appetit!
			</p>

			<p>
				The site also includes links to my favorite online cooking resources. One
				day, I hope to include a section of restaurant reviews.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you have recommendations, feel free to email me at jen@example.com.
